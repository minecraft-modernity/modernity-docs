## Economy & Banking

___
### Overview

Modernity has a strong focus on its economy. We have a custom banking system that allows players to open checking & savings accounts for easy money management. You can transfer money to other player's accounts, make deposits & withdrawals, and collect interest in a savings account.

Players may also register businesses, allowing them to easily hire players and manage company finances, as well as create shops to easily and automatically sell items to other players in exchange for cash.

### Managing & Creating Bank Accounts

You can open a bank account by travelling to the bank. Here, you can click on the villager to open the account creation menu.

You can create two types of accounts;
    Checking Accounts
- Low interest, low fees
 - Money is easily accessible
    Savings Accounts
- Higher interest, higher fees
 - Money is harder to get to

**TIP:** *You can find locations in the main city (NewPort) by using your GPS! Do `/gps` to get started!*
