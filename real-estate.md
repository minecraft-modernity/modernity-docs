## Real Estate

___
### Overview

Modernity has region management system that allows players to buy and sell pieces of real estate and lease these properties to any number of people (including automatic bank withdrawls for tenants). 

We've designed the estates part of the server to try and find a balance between realism and practicality; any person currently leasing will be able to modify any part of the leased property intentionally, however vandalism is illegal and mass grief against the rules (punishable by arrest and temporary bans respectively). 
It is up to the landlord and tenant to come up with agreeable terms to their lease and for both parties to hold up their end of the deal.

### Purchasing a Region

The listings menu is accessible either through the main menu or via the `/listings` command. Clicking on a listing will point your compass towards the location of that listing.

Once you are inside the bounds of the region, you can type `/buyregion` (also accessible via the main menu) to begin the purchase process. You will be directed to a menu where you may choose the payment method that you'd like (either bank transfer or cash). 

Once you've successfully made the payment, the region will be yours and you will be able to do with it what you wish.

### Managing Your Region

You can manage your property by running `/manage` in-game to bring up the property management GUI.

From here, you may do several things;
- Lease pieces of your property out to other players
- List your property for sale on the `/listings` menu
- Evict tenants

**TIP:** *Attract tenants by posting your listing in our Discord guild!*
